        <h3>NASA's Orion Spacecraft Enters Lunar Orbit a Week After Artemis I Launch</h3>
           
            <p style="text-align: left;">NASA's Orion spacecraft was placed in lunar orbit Friday, officials said, as the much-delayed Moon mission proceeded successfully.

                A little over a week after the spacecraft blasted off from Florida bound for the Moon, flight controllers "successfully performed a burn to insert Orion into a distant retrograde orbit," the US space agency said on its website.
                
                The spacecraft is to take astronauts to the Moon in the coming years — the first to set foot on its surface since the last Apollo mission in 1972.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Paytm to Resubmit Application for Authorisation of Payment Aggregator Services</h3>
           <p style="text-align: left;">Digital payments and financial services company Paytm has shared an update with the exchanges about its 100 percent subsidiary, Paytm Payments Services.

                The fintech company said that it has received a letter from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in response to an application from its subsidiary for the authorisation to provide payment aggregator services for online merchants.
                
                The company can now resubmit the application within 120 calendar days for the payment aggregator services. Ahead of that, the company will seek necessary approval for past downward investment from Paytm into its subsidiary, to comply with foreign direct investment guidelines.</p>

        <h3>All the big new rom-coms star the same people they did 20 years ago</h3>
            <p>Sometime in the 2010s, the mid-budget film began to disappear from Hollywood. Movies for grownups about love, justice, and the American way used to be a central part of the movie business. Since they lacked expensive stunts and explosives, they would rely on the power of their stars for appeal. When you went to the movies in the 1990s, odds were good you were going to see a movie star’s charisma on the big screen: Julia Roberts’s brilliant smile; George Clooney’s Cary Grant cool.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Who built Marilyn Monroe?</h3>
            <p>In 1953, Alfred Kinsey published his highly anticipated new report “Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.” The first edition of Playboy magazine hit newsstands. And three new movies made their premiere, one right after the other, all starring Playboy’s very first cover girl: Marilyn Monroe.</p>

        <h3>A paradigm shift: How the tides of ‘quiet quitting’ and ‘moonlighting’ are changing the work landscape</h3>
            <p>We’ve evolved far too much to deny the cyclical nature and patterns we see in the world. Antiquated trends fall back into vogue, bygone concepts find revival and sometimes, previously known phenomena become amplified and gain momentum in the age of social media. </p>
